# myFirstAiBotWebsite
A website which I designed in order to try on using neural networks in Tic-tac-toe. The site is also my first try using with js, html and css.

# General info
The current address for the website is: https://mysterious-lowlands-23508.herokuapp.com/ .
The files in this repo are only the enough to run the website locally.

# Organisation
Each folder designate different parts of the website, with each of the two Tic-tac-toe bots contained in separate subfolders.
