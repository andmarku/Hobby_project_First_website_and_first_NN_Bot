# myFirstWebsiteAndMyFirstAiBot
This is a website which I designed for fun and to learn a little about javascript, html, and css. On the website, I test using neural networks for a (not very good) Tic-tac-toe bot and test some simple visualisations for insights into the current state of the bots neural network.

# General info
The current address for the website is: https://mysterious-lowlands-23508.herokuapp.com/ .
Observe, however, that the files in this repo are only enough to run the website locally.

# Organisation
Each folder designate different parts of the website, with each of the two Tic-tac-toe bots contained in separate subfolders.
