# myFirstAiBotWebsite
This is a website which I designed in order to try on using neural networks as the basis for a Tic-tac-toe bot. The site is also my first try using with js, html and css.

# General info
The current address for the website is: https://mysterious-lowlands-23508.herokuapp.com/ .
Observe however that the files in this repo are only enough to run the website locally.

# Organisation
Each folder designate different parts of the website, with each of the two Tic-tac-toe bots contained in separate subfolders.
